So walk in the front door.’”\\n\\nTurns out Terenzio was right and the two celebrities walked straight into the hotel while the photographers were camped out at the side door.\\n\\nEven though JFK Jr. had a “respectful piece” in mind, according to Terenzio, the story never ended up happening.\\n\\n“She wrote John a note that said, ‘Thank you so much, but not right now,\\'” Terenzio recalls.\\n\\nAfter the meeting, JFK Jr. \"was very careful what he said,\" George magazine creative director Matt Berman told People. “The one funny thing he said was, ‘She’s got a great pair of legs.’”\\n\\nWhile he might not have mentioned that to his assistant, “I do remember him saying, ‘She’s really tall!’” Terenzio says. “He also said she was very shy. He was surprised how demure she was. I think they had both met Mother Theresa so they spoke about that. And he said how lovely she was.”',\n",

       " 'doc_1_text': 'American professional snowboarder  Jamie Louise Anderson (born September 13, 1990) is an American professional snowboarder. She won the gold medal in the inaugural Women\\'s Slopestyle Event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and repeated the feat at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, making her the first female snowboarder to win more than one Olympic gold medal.[1][2][3] She has won gold medals in slopestyle at the Winter X Games in consecutive years in 2007/8 and 2012/3. She has 21 X Games medals and is the second most decorated athlete[4]  Personal life [ edit ]  Anderson was born and raised in South Lake Tahoe, California, the fifth of eight children. She snowboarded for the first time at age nine and immediately fell in love with the sport. Anderson was homeschooled at Visions in Education, allowing her to spend almost every day on the mountains.[5][6]  Anderson currently resides in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada with her fiance, Tyler Nicholson, a Canadian snowboarder. She met Nicholson at a bar at Whistler, and they\\'ve been together since 2015. She also owns The Dream Inn, a private residence suite that overlooks Whistler Blackcomb Ski Resort and other private places in Tahoe and Colorado.  Aside from snowboarding, Anderson does yoga and meditation to keep her healthy for her upcoming competitions.[7] She is also a member of the POW\\'s Athlete Alliance & an ambassador for Protect Our Winters.  Career [ edit ]  Anderson has built a reputation as one of the top slopestyle riders in the business.[6][8] She has been one of the most successful female snowboarders on the Swatch TTR World Snowboard Tour and took home the gold medal in the Olympic debut of women\\'s snowboard slopestyle at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games.  In addition to her many career wins, Anderson has been giving back to the snowboarding community through participation in the High Cascade Snowboard Camp.[9] She hosted a Signature Session™ at High Cascade in 2009–2012 and was scheduled to host another Signature Session™ camp in 2014.  Anderson began snowboarding in 2000 when she received a hand-me-down snowboard at the age of nine and qualified for the 2004 Winter X Games just four years later. In 2005, she took home a bronze, becoming the youngest female medalist in the competition at age 15.  Through the Jamie Anderson Foundation[10] established in 2013, she has provided more than 30 young winter sports athletes with equipment, clothing, season passes and financial backing for travel to the USASA national competitions.  During the 2006–2007 season, Anderson won the TTR 6Star Burton US Open Snowboarding Championships slopestyle, and the Roxy Chicken Jam emporium in Kaprun, Austria, the quarterpipe event at the O\\'Neill Evolution in Davos, the Billabong slopestyle Jam and the Abominable Snow man.  With impressive[neutrality is disputed] results at all major events on the TTR World Snowboard Tour in 2007–2008, among those victories at the Burton European Open slopestyle and the Roxy Chicken Jam US slopestyle, she took home the Women\\'s Swatch TTR World Snowboard Tour Champion title.[11]  Event Star Tier Format Position Garnier Fructis Australian Open 5star SS 1 Roxy Chicken Jam Europe 6Star SS 2 Burton European Open 6Star SS 1 Nissan X-Trail Nippon Open 5Star SS 2 Chevy Grand Prix 5Star SS 3 Burton US Open 6Star SS 2 Roxy Chicken Jam US 6Star SS 1  Anderson started the season with the first half-pipe victory of her career with a win in both the slopestyle and halfpipe events of the 5-Star Burton New Zealand Open. After her successful start and after leading the rankings for over 40 weeks, Anderson finished the season in third place on the Swatch TTR Tour due to injury.[12]  Event Star Tier Format Position Burton New Zealand Open 5star SS 1 Burton New Zealand Open 5Star HP 1 Billabong Snowstock 3Star BA 1 Burton Australian Open 5Star HP 3 Burton Australian Open 5Star SS 1 Burton European Open 6Star SS 1 Nissan X-Trail Nippon Open 5Star SS 2  Again, there was another promising kick-off for Anderson on the TTR World Tour with a win at the 5-Star Burton New Zealand Open slopestyle and the 3Star Billabong Bro Down in Australia. Anderson continued her season with good results from the Winter Dew Tour, finishing off the season in the lead of the Winter Dew Tour Cup Standings.  Anderson then returned to the TTR Tour and took home the Roxy Chicken Jam US slopestyle title and a podium finish at the Burton US Open slopestyle. She ended her season in world no. 5[clarification needed] on the Swatch TTR World Tour. Anderson ended her season in the no. 1 spot on the Swatch TTR World Tour.  Anderson won an Olympic gold medal, the first ever offered in slopestyle, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[13][14]  Anderson won her second Olympic gold medal at the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea. She also won a silver in the big air event. This was the second time slopestyle had been offered in the Olympics, so Anderson has won both gold medals in slopestyle in Olympic history, making her the first female snowboarder to win more than one Olympic gold medal.  Anderson won a bronze medal in the big air event at the 2019 Winter X Games Aspen.[15] She also participated the 2019 FIS Snowboard World Championships where she won a bronze medal and denounced the FIS President Gian-Franco Kasper in response to an article from Deadspin, where Kasper \"denied the existence of climate change and spoke disparagingly about immigrants and lauded the ease of working with dictators to organize Olympic Games.\" Her winnings in that event were donated to Protect Our Winters, and she urged her fellow competitors to do the same thing on her Instagram post.[16] In 2020, she won a gold medal in the slopestyle event at the 2020 Burton US Open and at the 2020 Winter X Games Aspen, where she became the most-medaled female competitor in the history of X Games.[17]  Television appearances [ edit ]  In 2015, Anderson competed on the seventh season of The Celebrity Apprentice for her charity, Protect Our Winters.[18] She was fired in the fourth episode.  In April 2018, Anderson was announced as one of the celebrities who will compete on season 26 of Dancing with the Stars. She was partnered with professional dancer Artem Chigvintsev.[19] She was eliminated on the first episode, and she finished in 9th place.',\n",

       " 'doc_2_text': '\"I\\'m gonna win for him,\" says a tearful Lindsey Vonn as she seeks Olympic success to honor her late grandfather.  DESPERATELY alone, dateless and wondering why everybody can find love except you?  No, this isn’t a casting call for Married At First Sight, it’s more of a public service announcement to ease your pain.  You might be eating ice cream straight from the tub while watching Love Actually for the 13th time on a Friday night but don’t despair — you’ve got more in common with an Olympic gold medallist than you might think.  We can’t confirm skiing legend Lindsey Vonn’s Friday night habits involve the above activities, but one thing we know for sure is the glamorous American can’t score herself a date.  It’s pretty remarkable considering what she brings to the table. The 33-year-old is attractive, articulate, famous and an Olympic icon.  Perhaps that’s too intimidating a task for single guys to tackle right now.  A post shared by L I N D S E Y • V O N N (@lindseyvonn) on May 28, 2017 at 8:46am PDT  Fresh from winning bronze in the ladies’ downhill at the recently completed Winter Games in PyeongChang, Vonn was the toast of America. She won gold in the same event at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 and Bronze in the Super-G program.  That she was able to medal in what was her final Olympic campaign was a seriously impressive effort — but not impressive enough to win her a boyfriend.  Vonn’s list of ex-partners includes golf star Tiger Woods and NFL assistant coach Kenan Smith (they broke up in November), while she was also married to fellow skier Thomas Vonn for four years.  But she’s going through a dry spell.  Vonn was vocal about her desire to find a man in South Korea, hoping Twitter would get the job done.  So apparently it’s Valentine’s Day....I forgot all about it because I’m at the #Olympics and I’m single. Anyone else out there single and want to be my valentine? 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️ #worthashot — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 14, 2018  It didn’t, and neither did appearing on the red carpet at this week’s Oscars.  Vonn attended Hollywood’s night of nights with her sister Karin but while some actors left with a little gold statue, she left without even a phone number.  A despondent Vonn revealed not even the after-parties provided her with any luck.  “I didn’t (meet anyone),” Vonn told US show Access Live. “They were all either married or dating or not available.  “I haven’t really had any offers. I didn’t have one guy talk to me that wasn’t married or taken at the entire night, all the after parties, not one guy at the Oscars.”  And so started a segment where hosts Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover went through celebrities to find who would be the best fit for Vonn. They couldn’t believe no man would want her so made it their mission to find Vonn a partner.  Vonn said Mad Men star Jon Hamm was “doable, in the mix” and, unsurprisingly, gave two thumbs up to Brad Pitt.  “Yeah, sure, you guys want to facilitate that? Why not, let’s go. Brad’s everyone’s type,” she said.  Rapper Drake wasn’t really up her alley though. “He’s good looking. I’ve met him a few times, but he’s dated a few people that I know. I’m not sure. He can make a rap song about me and I’m totally fine with that,” Vonn said.  If Drake was a soft no, Vonn rejected New England Patriots NFL star Rob Gronkowski by shouting it from the rooftops.  “I love Gronk, but that is never going to happen,” she said. “I can say never! It’s never going to happen.”  Funnyman Chris Pratt sounded like he was in with a shot, even though Vonn let out an ominous “oohh” when his name came up. It sounded like a match with Pratt would make Vonn’s sister Karin happier than her, because she believes the skier needs more “funny” in her life.  “Oohh. I like Pratt, I like Chris. He’s very funny. Karin says I need more funny in my life,” Vonn said. “I have not (met Pratt). I went to his premiere of Jurassic World but he was married at the time.”  We said at the start this had nothing to do with Married At First Sight, but if you watched Vonn’s appearance on Access Live, you could be forgiven for thinking the talk show had turned into a reality dating program.  Think cult favourite If You Are The One only the available partners aren’t there to have their say. Instead, they appear on a screen and the hosts do the matchmaking for them.  If you don’t know what that show is, then chances are you’re not alone on the couch at 11pm eating those tubs of ice cream while watching late night SBS.  Of all the contenders, Vonn was most enthusiastic about Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. The pair share the same stylist, and Vonn is hoping to use him to set up a first date.  “He’s very cute,” Vonn said. “My stylist — he’s trying to facilitate (dinner). I’m trying to get the ball rolling on this one, but it hasn’t happened and he’s already shooting his next movie.”  Beautiful and talented but bang out of luck — that’s not really how many people would think the world works for someone like Vonn.  It prompted a revelation you’d never expect to hear from someone with her profile. “I don’t know if I can compete (with other women),” she said.  But don’t worry. There’s no chance of Vonn giving up on love, locking herself at home and becoming a crazy cat lady. After all, she’s got dogs.  “I’ve got three dogs,” she said. “Who needs a guy when you’ve got three dogs?”',\n",

Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.\\n\\nThen, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film “Aladdin.”\\n\\nSix years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl’s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.\\n\\n“I never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‘Cinderella’ stories that I’d be a Disney princess. I think it’s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,” said Salonga in a recent phone interview.\\n\\nSalonga’s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\\n\\n“We made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I’m going to love singing,” said Salonga, “and because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.”\\n\\nSalonga is keeping the program’s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\\n\\n“This will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.”\\n\\nA regular feature of Salonga’s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin.”\\n\\n“No need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn’t have to have it memorized fully,” she said. “I want them to have fun.”\\n\\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 “Les Misérables” Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical “Allegiance,” which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.\\n\\nSplitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show “The Voice.” In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing” (1997) and “By Heart” (1999).\\n\\nOn this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.\\n\\n“I get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,” Salonga said. “It’s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.”\\n\\nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com',\n",

The actress, who just wrapped the series finale of her long running CBS drama in June, told CNN she’s only beginning to adjust to life after Alicia Florrick.  “I haven’t missed [the show] yet,” she told CNN at The ACE Awards in New York on Tuesday night. “We probably would be in our third week back at work now if I was still doing it. I really wonder, now that I have the time to think about it, how I did seven years of that show because just the legal dialogue alone. My mind was never still.”  Margulies said that right after she taped the last episode, she got sick. “I have been really actually wondering how I just kept going. So the exhaustion when it all finally ended, hit me with a bout of the chickenpox for two weeks. I felt like, sort of my body having to shut down and shed seven years of great hard work and start anew. I really took it that way.”  Related Link: ‘The Good Wife’ series finale reaches a frustrating verdict  Margulies, who has won two Emmy Awards for her work on “The Good Wife,” admitted that she was surprised the hit show wasn’t nominated this year.  “I thought this season was our strongest season, to be honest,” Margulies said. “It’s someone else’s turn. I’ve won plenty and I’ve been nominated plenty.”  Margulies didn’t pause long before for taking on a new role. She’ll play Richard Gere’s wife in the upcoming movie, “The Three Christs of Ypsilanti.” The film is already in production and Margulies said she’s enjoying her new gig.  “Oh, it’s heaven,” she said. “He is genuine, he’s not fussy [Gere]. After our first day, it was as if we had been married for 10 years already. He’s just lovely, I mean honestly, he’s truly a dream.”',\n",
